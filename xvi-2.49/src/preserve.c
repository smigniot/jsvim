* program name:
    xvi
* function:
    Portable version of UNIX "vi" editor, with extensions.
* module name:
    preserve.c
* module function:
    Buffer preservation routines.

    The exPreserveAllBuffers() routine saves the contents of all
    modified buffers in temporary files. It can be invoked with the
    :preserve command or it may be called by one of the system
    interface modules when at least PSVKEYS keystrokes have been
    read, & at least Pn(P_preservetime) seconds have elapsed
    since the last keystroke. (PSVKEYS is defined in xvi.h.) The
    preservebuf() routine can be used to preserve a single buffer.
