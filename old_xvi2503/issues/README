		  Keeping issues in the source tree

Xvi now keeps its issues in the source tree instead of on some web server.
That way, the issue files refers to the version of the source code they
accompany, one can work on the issues when not on the internet and they
aren't all get lost when the company closes down or when your friend's
web server dies unexpectedly with no recent backups.

Each issue is tracked by a text file in the "isuues/open" directory.
The file is created when the issue is discovered, modified as its analysis
proceeds and is deleted with the commit that resolves it. At that point,
some of its contents may become commentary in its regression test file:

Open bugs are easy to see because they still have files in issues/open/.
It shouldn't be too hard to get a history of closed bugs with a script that
trawls the git history and fishes out the last versions of any files
that have been deleted from issues/open/.
