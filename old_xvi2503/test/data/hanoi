" Everyone seems to be writing stupid Tower of Hanoi programs.
" Well, here is the stupidest of them all: the hanoi solving vi macros.
" 
" Save this article, unshar it, and run uudecode on hanoi.vi.macros.uu.
" This will give you the macro file hanoi.vi.macros.
" Then run vi (with no file: just type "vi") and type:
" 	:so hanoi.vi.macros
" 	g
" and watch it go.
" 
" The default height of the tower is 7 but can be easily changed by editing
" the macro file.
" 
" The disks aren't actually shown in this version, only numbers representing
" each disk, but I believe it is possible to write some macros to show the
" disks moving about as well. Any takers?
" 
" (For maze solving macros, see alt.sources or comp.editors)

" This is changed from the original:
"	< map K 1Go
"	> map K 1Gc$
" so that it works with nvi (based on elvis) which starts with 0 lines, not 1.

" to set the height of the tower, change the digit in the following
