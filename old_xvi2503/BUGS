Known bugs in xvi 2.50, 25 April 2017
=====================================

* UTF-8 characters are not supported so on recent Linux systems,
  accented characters display as \303\250.

* If it runs out of RAM, often it is unable to save the file.

* It doesn't recognise multiple commands separated by | on the :command line

* :@ and :* with a line range only execute the ex commands in the named buffer
  for the last line. They should execute them for each line in the range.

* On Unix, pressing Control-\ makes xvi dump core immediately.
  Whether it should or not, as that key generates SIGQUIT, is unclear.

* When you try to open more files than will fit on a screen with an odd number
  of lines (e.g. xvi -s autosplit=100 *.c) all except the first open at line 2.

* :abbreviate and :unabbreviate are not implemented.

* :w>> is not implemented.

* It doesn't run the maze-solving macros.

* On NetBSD with "make check", all tests seem to succeed but
  in reality none are run.

* If the standard input returns EOF indefinitely, xvi hangs consuming
  100% CPU. It should exit, saving what buffers it can.
