xvi doesn't understand TAGS files created by etags

Xvi understands classic
	symbol\tfile\tlineno
"tags" files and ctags'
	F_OK    unix.h  134;"   d
	Flexbuf xvi.h   /^Flexbuf;$/;"  t       typeref:struct:__anon25
but doesn't grok etags' "TAGS" files.
For example, "make tags" in sox creates "TAGS" containing lines like:
	} priv_t;^?priv_t^A19,500
	static int start(sox_effect_t * effp)^?start^A21,511
	#define fifo_included^?fifo_included^A19,847
	UNUSED static void fifo_clear(fifo_t * f)^?fifo_clear^A37,1268
and
	/home/martin/score/sox/src/TAGS,include

I'm not sure where one is supposed to find the symbol in that;
from the DEL to the Ctrl-A?
