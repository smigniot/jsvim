The test suite fails to execute on OpenSUSE, with internal errors

On gcc117.fsffrance.org of the GCC Compile Farm, OpenSUSE on aarch64,
I have to install GNU termcap, tcl and expect under my home directory,
add
	export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib
	export TCL_LIBRARY=$HOME/lib/tcl8.4
	export TCLLIBPATH=$HOME/lib
	export MANPATH=$HOME/man:$MANPATH
to .profile (and source .profile)

# Install termcap library

	wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/termcap/termcap-1.3.1.tar.gz
	gunzip < termcap*gz | tar xf -
	( cd termcap* && ./configure --prefix=$HOME && make install )
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib

# Install tcl

	wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/tcl8.6.6-src.tar.gz
	gunzip < tcl*gz | tar xf -
	( cd tcl*/unix && ./configure --prefix=$HOME && make install )

# Install expect

    wget https://downloads.sf.net/project/expect/Expect/5.45/expect5.45.tar.gz
    gunzip < expect*gz | tar xf -
    ( cd expect &&
On aarch64, expect 5.45 needs tclconfig/config.sub modifying to add:

         | alphapca5[67]-* | alpha64pca5[67]-* | arc-* \
         | arm-*  | armbe-* | armle-* | armeb-* | armv*-* \
>        | aarch64-* \
         | avr-* \
         | bs2000-* \

then
      ./configure --prefix=$HOME	# --build=aarch64-suse-linux
      make install
    )
