This is a source release of the Xvi editor (derived from "STEVIE"), a
clone of the UNIX editor `vi'. The program was originally developed
for the Atari ST, but has been ported to UNIX, MS-DOS, OS/2 and QNX as
well.

Xvi is a portable multi-window version of `vi'. In spite of its name,
there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific version of it, but work is
still in progress. Existing versions use text windows separated by
horizontal status lines on character mode displays.  The windows may
represent different files being edited, or different views on to the
same file.

Unix, MS-DOS and QNX versions have now been in regular use by the
authors, and many of our colleagues, for about three and a half years,
and the editor's behaviour seems fairly satisfactory.

This source code is not in the public domain, but is provided for free,
subject to the license conditions set out in the COPYING file.

The files included in the `doc' directory are:

README
	What you're reading.

COPYING
	The license under which xvi is provided. Please read and
	understand this license if you are going to re-distribute xvi.

Makefile
	Unix runes to generate the .txt and .ps files from the source files.

../src/xvi.help
	The help file used by xvi.

source.ms
source.txt
source.ps
	A guide to the Xvi source code, including information about
	how to port Xvi to different systems. Provided in [nt]roff -ms
	source and nroff output as text and PostScript.

xvi.1
xvi.txt
xvi.ps
	A Unix-style manual page, in [nt]roff -man & nroff output.

Chances are, if you're on UNIX, MS-DOS or QNX, you'll be able
to compile xvi without changing anything. Change directory
into `src', pick a makefile and go for it.

If that doesn't work, read doc/source.ms.
